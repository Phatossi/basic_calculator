## Basic Calculator

This is a simple application that is launched via command line. It also gets the input via command line and displays the result through it. 
This calculator supports the calculation of only four basic arithmetic operations, namely adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. 
Only one operator per expression is currently supported. The expressions that are calculated are written in an external text file named 
'history.txt'.
